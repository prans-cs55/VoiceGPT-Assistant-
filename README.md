🤖 AI Assistant: Uses OpenAI GPT to process messages, answer questions, translate, summarize, and more.

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts GPT’s response back into natural-sounding speech.

🌐 Flask Web App: Clean web interface with microphone input and text chat.

🎨 UI Controls: Toggle light/dark mode and select preferred voice.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI: OpenAI GPT (via openai library)

Speech Services: IBM Watson STT & TTS (via REST APIs)
